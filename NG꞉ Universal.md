# NG: Universal

## Why SSR can be necessary?

### User retention

SPA visually displays a blank page until the app is rendered.  
This can take seconds, and many impatient users can close the page and never visit it again.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Google's search engine crawlers are now capable of indexing even the content generated by JS.  
But many other search engines &mdash; can't, so we need to include some metadata in the `index.html` initially served.

Social media crawlers also need static metadata to display nice preview for emdedded links to our website.
