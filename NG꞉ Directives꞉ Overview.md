# NG: Directives: Overview

NG directive &mdash; a class decorated with `@Directive` (or `@Component`) that adds **additional behavior to DOM elements**.

Directive types:
- **Components** (most common): directives with templates (declared using `@Component` decorator)
- **attribute** directives: change the appearance or behavior of an element, component or another directive
- **structural** directives: change DOM structure by adding or removing DOM elements
