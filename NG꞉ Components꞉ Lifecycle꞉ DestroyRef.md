# NG: Components: Lifecycle: DestroyRef

Since NG v16, it's now possible to use **`takeUntilDestroyed()`** RxJs operator to unsubscribe from RxJs subscriptions when a component/directive/service is being destroyed.

Previously:
```
private destroy = new Subject();
...
someObservable.pipe(
  ...,
  takeUntil(this.destroy)
);
...
public ngOnDestroy(): void {
  this.destroy.next();
  this.destroy.complete();
}
```

New pattern:
```
someObservable.pipe(
  ...,
  takeUntilDestroyed()
);
```

Inside C/D/services, `takeUntilDestroyed()` doesn't need any args.

Outside of injection context, `takeUntilDestroyed()` must be passed an instance of `DestroyRef`.
