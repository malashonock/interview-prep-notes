# interview-prep-notes

I created this repo to keep my student notes when I prepare for tech interviews.  
Paper notes are great, but you can't modify / rearrange them after you've written anything.  
Locally, I use Notable for Ubuntu to work on the notes, and Git + Github to make them available for reading on a mobile phone.
