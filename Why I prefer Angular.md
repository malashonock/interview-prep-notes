# Why I prefer Angular

- Adherence to OOP paradigm:
  - classes & decorators
  - dependency injection
  - overall, feels closer to C#
- Native TypeScript support:
  - written in TS (easier debugging)
  - supports TS code only (no plain JS option)
- Comprehensive & opinionated:
  - no need to choose from numerous libs for every concern in the app
  - promotes usage of standard architectural building blocks (c/d/p, services, guards, interceptors, etc.)
  - more uniform coding style (easier code review)
- CLI
  - in NG itself
  - major 3rd party libs provide schematics
